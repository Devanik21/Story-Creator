🦖 Predatory Dynamics and Aggressiveness AnalysisSimulation Run: Primordial RunAnalyst: Intelligent Prince's AssistantExecutive SummaryThe simulation results from the Primordial Run indicate a definitive shift towards predatory and aggressive strategies. By the final generation (Gen 20), "peaceful" organisms have largely been outcompeted by those utilizing ATTACK, STEAL, and POISON mechanics. Aggression is currently the dominant survival strategy in this universe.1. Dominance of Aggressors in Final PopulationAnalysis of the final_population_genotypes reveals that high-fitness survivors have almost universally evolved offensive rule sets.The "Thief" StrategyOrganisms have evolved to detect neighbors and steal energy rather than generating it purely through synthesis.Genotype: geno_8a65efFitness: ~39.7Behavior: Contains specific logic to STEAL resources upon detecting a neighbor.The "Killer" StrategyDirect combat has emerged as the most efficient path to high fitness. These organisms actively hunt others.Genotype: geno_1008d9 (Highest Fitness in Set)Fitness: ~41.0Behavior:Primary: ATTACK action triggered by neighbor detection and specific energy thresholds.Secondary: Uses POISON as a supplementary offensive tool.2. Fitness Comparison: Predators vs. PassiveThere is a massive disparity in fitness scores between the early, passive generations and the late-stage predators.StagePrimary StrategyAvg. Fitness RangeEarly (Gen 0-5)Photosynthesis/Chemosynthesis< 2.0Late (Gen 20)Predation/Theft39.0 - 41.0Implication: Predation is currently orders of magnitude more efficient for energy gain than environmental harvesting.3. Evolutionary Dynamics (Red Queen Effect)The history logs indicate "Red Queen" dynamics—a constant evolutionary arms race—driven by this aggression.Generation 9: Parasitic adaptation event targeting the Echo-Silicon-Shard_53 kingdom.Generation 16: Adaptation event where parasites specifically evolved to target the Carbon kingdom.4. Contributing FactorsThe following simulation settings likely contributed to this outcome:global_predation_intensity: Set to 5.0 (Very High).Resource Scarcity: If environmental energy is hard to find, organisms turn to the "dense" energy packets found in other organisms (meat).ConclusionYour universe has successfully simulated a "Darwinian Arena." The "Intelligent Prince" has created a highly competitive environment where only the strongest and most aggressive lineages survive. To encourage cooperative or peaceful behavior, the cost of attacking would need to be increased or the global_predation_intensity lowered.
